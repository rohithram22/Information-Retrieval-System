# Homework3: Crawling, Merging, Vertical Search

Code submitted by : < ROHITH CHANDRA KANDAMBETH > | < CS6200> | < 002784518 >

## Objective
Implement your own index that would replace the one from elasticsearch used in HW1, then index the document collection used in HW1. Your index should be able to handle large numbers of documents and terms without using excessive memory or disk I/O.

This assignment involves writing two programs:

1. Task 1 - Crawler
2. Task 2 - Link Graph
3. Task3: Merging team indexes
3. Task4: Vertical Search (MS students only)

## Notes

This Homework combines individual responsibility with team collaboration. While you will work closely with your team members, your individual effort in developing the crawler, collecting documents, and following the politeness policy is crucial for the project's success.
