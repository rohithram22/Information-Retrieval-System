Part of their evidence stemmed from the fact that disloyal\\nofficers mounted two coups against him.\\n   But the general, who sometimes seemed to escape by magic,\\napparently retained enough loyalty for his men to put up a fight\\nwhen the U.S. stroke came. From Defense Forces posts all over\\nPanama came reports of stubborn fighting that lasted for hours.\\n   With their garrisons destroyed or under siege, many Panamanian\\nofficers left and joined small paramilitary groups in urban\\nguerrilla warfare.\\n   While U.S. forces had heavy artillery and air power to use\\nagainst installations and sent their armored personnel carriers\\nrolling over fences and cars, Panamanian armed groups fought a\\ndelaying action.\\n   ``We are acting as urban guerrillas, although we have lost some\\npositions, some garrisons,'' said Enrique Thompson, the second in\\ncommand in the paramilitary groups, known as Dignity Battalions.\\n   Thompson spoke with an Associated Press reporter as the five men\\nwith him took up positions in the bushes with Soviet-made AK-47\\nrifles near the Tinajitas garrison, taken over Wednesday morning by\\nthe Americans.\\n   ``The people are joining the struggle for national\\nsovereignty,'' he said.\\n   The Noriega forces marshalled resistance with appeals over the\\nNational Radio, broadcasting in a national network.\\n   Announcers called on Panamanians to organize neighborhood armed\\nresistance and guerrilla war. The station played Panamanian\\npatriotic songs that taunt Americans. Officers even used it to\\nbroadcast instructions to troops and messages to each other, often\\nin code.\\n   U.S. forces finally did slowly close down the radio stations\\nthat made up the chain, but it was a slow process.\\n   ``Incredible,'' said a sweaty U.S. Army sergeant as he listened\\nto the exhortations. ``That was the first thing we should have\\nsilenced.''\\n   Unlike the armed forces in other parts of Latin America, the\\nDefense Forces officer corps is made up largely of men from poor\\nbackgrounds and became the vehicle dictator Omar Torrijos used in\\nthe late 1960s to topple the ruling oligarchy.\\n   Noriega, a Torrijos disciple, once observed that the upper-class\\nhad only itself to blame when they complained about the Defense\\nForces' dominance, because they preferred to make money.\\n   He openly mocked the upper-class and his supporters frequently\\nrefer to the opposition election victory on May 7 as an effort by\\nthe oligarchy to return to power.\\n   Noriega promoted officers with poor backgrounds, often from\\ndiscriminated-against black and Chinese minorities, and worked hard\\nto retain their loyalty with lucrative slices of the corruption pie\\nin Panama.\\n   But when that loyalty slipped, it did in coup attempts in 1988\\nand 1989, he reacted brutally, and reports that he personally beat\\nor shot coup instigators circulated.\\n   Accused of domestic repression by the U.S. government, he\\nwhipped up nationalistic feelings showing himself as a Panamanian\\nwrongly accused by the large country that wanted to renege on the\\nthe Panama Canal treaties.\\n   The invasion was a slap in the face to Panamanians who have\\nconsidered themselves friends and allies of the Americans since the\\ntwo countries joined hands in the construction of the Panama Canal\\nat the beginning of the century.\\n   As the armored personnel carriers rolled out of Fort Clayton\\nafter midnight Wednesday past the Panamanian town of Diablo\\nHeights, some men and women watching them cursed them or cried.\\n   ``Whey are they doing this?'' a housewife asked a reporter.\\n``Are they going to kill our people just for one man?''\\n   ``The Americans have no control of the situation,'' said Dr.\\nLeonardo Diaz of the Santo Tomas hospital. ``Their strength is in\\ntheir personnel carriers and their Cobras (helicopters), but the\\npeople are angry.''\"]\n",

      "['This first installment of a three-part Christmas\\nseries about the relatives of Jesus deals with his ancestral roots.', \"Everyone is a special sum of ancestry _ to enhance or diminish\\nthrough a lifetime. That was so for the child of Christmas, the\\nproduct of a heritage.\\n   Some biblical passages cloak his origins in utter mystery,\\nbefore time itself. But others accord him a thoroughly natural\\nfamily tree.\\n   ``He was in the beginning with God,'' says one account, a\\n``Word'' or ``Logos,'' a vitalizing wisdom inherent in the Creator\\nbefore the world began. Yet other passages say he was ``made like\\nhis brethren in every respect.''\\n   ``Son of man,'' he usually called himself, but also ``Son of\\nGod.''\\n   He combined ``universality with particularity,'' the ``divine\\nand human model,'' writes church historian Jaroslav Pelican in his\\nbook ``Jesus Through the Centuries.'' It says a key question put to\\nhim was, ``Where do you come from?''\\n   Although seldom noted, he had a long string of forebears as well\\nas contemporary relatives who gave him both problems and help. His\\nlineage ran deep into Jewish history.\\n   As with most people if their descent is traced back far enough,\\nhe had a checkered ancestry, good and bad, the lowly and great,\\nkings, betrayers, heroes, adulterers, warriors and prostitutes.\\n   It was an odd assortment, like humanity itself, alien Gentiles\\nand fellow Jews, the weak and strong, upright and corrupt. The fact\\nthat he shared these common roots is considered theologically basic\\nto his purpose: becoming identified with all humankind.\\n   They ``were all members of Jesus' family, his great-great-great\\ngrandaddies and grandmamas in the faith,'' wrote church scholar\\nWilliam H. Willimon. ``For all their weaknesses and shortcomings,\\nthis motley but richly human crew were indeed his people.''\\n   Two genealogies of Jesus are recorded, one in the first chapter\\nof the Book of Matthew, the other in the third chapter of the Book\\nof Luke. They vary in some detail and some interpreters debatably\\nassume Luke gives the line of his mother, Mary, and that Matthew\\ngives that of Joseph, legally the father.\\n   ``It is possible that the original genealogy did interpret\\nJoseph as the father of Jesus, that is, that it had been formulated\\nbefore the understanding of Jesus as the divinely generated son of\\nGod,'' writes New Testament scholar Henrikus Boers in his book\\n``Who Was Jesus?''\\n   Some progenitors are on both lists, including olden patriarchs\\nof Judaism and Israel's great King David, along with other lesser\\nfigures of sundry character.\\n   Matthew lists 41 ancestors, starting back at the time of\\nAbraham, ancient father of Israel, and other early patriarchs,\\nIsaac and Jacob.\\n   Luke lists 77 progenitors in reverse order, starting with Joseph\\nand enumerating others going back to the first man, Adam, and\\nfinally to his creator, God.\\n   Other figures out of dim antiquity also are included, such as\\nNoah, and that legend of longevity, Methuselah, who lived 969\\nyears, all designated ancestors of Jesus.\\n   In the mostly male lists, four women are named, and they're a\\nmixed group _ a soldier's beautiful wife, Bathsheba, seduced by\\nKing David; the harlot of Jericho, Rahab; the sexually maneuvering\\nCananite, Tamar; and the loyal Mohabite, Ruth.\\n   Tamar was the daugher-in-law of Judah, son of the patriarch\\nJacob. Her husband died and after prolonged widowhood, she\\ndisguised herself as a prostitute and enticed her father-in-law to\\nlie with her. She bore twins, one named Perez, also among Jesus'\\nforbears.\\n   Rahab was a harlot who sheltered two scouts sent by the\\nIsraelite warrior-leader Joshua to spy out Jericho before taking\\nit. She hid them from searchers in flax stalks on her rooftop.\\n   She later helped the pair escape, lowering them on a rope from a\\nwindow in her house, which was built into the city wall. By\\nagreement with the two, her clan was spared when Jericho was\\ndestroyed, her house marked by a scarlet cord hung from a window.\\n   The devoted woman of Moab, Ruth, widowed by her Hebrew husband,\\ninsisted on returning with her mother-in-law, Naomi, to Israel,\\nwith these memorable words: ``For where you go I will go ... your\\npeople will be my people, and your God my God.''\\n   On Naomi's advice, Ruth worked in the harvest, sleeping at the\\nfeet of the owner, Boaz, thus winning him as her husband. They were\\nparents of Obed, father of Jesse, who fathered King David.\\n   His philandering with Bathsheba, the gorgeous wife of an absent\\nmilitary officer, Uriah, produced sons Nathan and future King\\nSolomon, alternatively listed in Jesus' line of descent.\\n   Other men on the lists also displayed foibles, such as Jacob's\\ndeceiving his father to gain an inheritance, and even Abraham\\nfearfully palming off his lovely wife, Sarah, as his ``sister'' to\\nplacate the ruling pharaoh while temporarily in Egypt.\\n   Nevertheless, those honored patriarchs also displayed courage,\\ninitiative and devotion in their covenant with God to lead a people\\nthat would be a promised ``light to the nations.''\\n   The great Israelite military commander, Joshua, successor to\\nMoses, also is listed, along with a long succession of kings,\\ndecent and debauched, in addition to charming, psalm-singing David\\nand wise Solomon, credited with the Book of Proverbs and builder of\\nJerusalem's first Temple.\\n   Other kings include Rehoboam, whose oppressions, idolatrous\\nrites and immoralities stirred a revolt that divided the kingdom;\\nUzziah, stricken with leprosy in a prosperous reign, and Hezekiah\\nwho led reforms under guidance of the prophet Micah.\\n   Also listed is Manasseh, described as ``the most wicked king of\\nJudah,'' whose religious deviations included Baalism, exaltation of\\nthe idol Astarte, wizardry and Molech worship that involved forcing\\nchildren through fire.\\n   Tradition has it that Manasseh had the great prophet Isaiah\\nsawed asunder.\\n   One king listed, Josiah, took the throne at age 8 when his\\nfather, Amon, was murdered. But Josiah had a long, just reign,\\nousting corrupt priests and recovering the lost ``Book of law'' in\\nrepairing the Temple.\\n   Of many others named, some are clouded, uncertain figures, while\\nothers are notable in Jewish annals, such as Judah, founder of a\\nmain Israelite tribe, and the prophet Nathan who rebuked David for\\nhis illicit affair.\\n   The mixed lot of people, with their sundry faults and strengths,\\nwere all ``part of the promise fulfilled'' by the Christ child,\\nWillimon writes. They, ``for all their weaknesses, ... were\\ninstruments of the promise.''\\n   On the other hand, Jesus' descent also is traced directly to the\\nGodhead, adding an unfathomable engima to his humanity.\\n   ``In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and\\nthe Word was God,'' says the distinctively interpretative gospel of\\nJohn. ``And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace\\nand truth.''\\n   He is ``fully God and fully man,'' classic Christian doctrine\\nsays. His conception by the virgin Mary is ascribed by the gospels\\nto divine intervention. St. Paul calls him the ``image of the\\ninvisible God.''\\n   Jesus himself, though he was generally elusive about it and\\nthough he identified closely with common folk, sometimes laid it\\nout plainly, as related by John's gospel:\\n   ``Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am,'' he\\nsaid. ``I and the Father are one ... the Father is in me and I am\\nin the Father.''\"]\n",

Some analysts say he is seeking stronger\\nties with rigid Communist systems similarly opposed to political\\nreform, particularly North Korea, Cuba and China.\\n   His leadership is based on a family dynasty with some 40\\nrelatives reportedly placed in key state and party jobs. His wife\\nElena, virtual second-in-command in Romania, is a Politburo member\\nand first vice premier.\\n   One of Ceausescu's brothers, Ilie, is an army general and deputy\\ndefense minister. Another brother, Nicolae Andruta, is a police\\ngeneral and deputy interior minister and another brother, Ion, is\\nin charge of economic planning.\\n   His youngest son, Nicu, 39, is a Politburo candidate member and\\nparty chief of Sibiu region in southern Transylvania.\\n   ``Romania is a showcase for any repressive totalitarian state.\\nThe harsher the repression, the more violent the public upheaval it\\nbrings about and the greater the desire to take revenge on\\nleaders,'' Ion Ratiu, chairman of the London-based World Union of\\nFree Romanians, said Monday.\\n   Since he became party leader in 1965, Ceausescu has exercised\\nabsolute power and carried out a foreign policy independent of the\\nSoviet Union.\\n   While that maverick stance won him praise and credits from the\\nWest, Ceausescu kept Romanians under iron-fisted control. Now, with\\nreform ascendent in the rest of the Warsaw Pact, the harsh Romanian\\nstand draws condemnation from abroad.\\n   About 30,000 coal miners went on strike in the Jiu Valley in\\n1977 and 10,000 workers demonstrated in the city of Brasov in 1987\\ndemanding freedom, better living conditions and Ceausescu's ouster.\\nPolice arrested hundreds of demonstrators and their leaders\\ndisappeared.\\n   An extensive secret police force keeps strict control on\\nreligious and political expression, and dissent is quickly crushed,\\nmaking chances for peaceful change in Romania seem remote.\\n   But poverty and despair engendered by economic problems and\\npolitical repressions could cause people to risk direct\\nconfrontations with armed forces, as in Timisoara now.\\n   Unlike recent protests in Prague and East Germany, witnessed and\\nreported by the Western media, demonstrations in Romania have taken\\nplace well outside the public eye.\\n   The Western reporters permitted into the country in recent years\\nhave been kept under close watch, and police have detained\\njournalists and even diplomats attempting to visit the country's\\nfew dissidents.\\n   Romania has closed its borders and barred most foreigners from\\nentering the country in an apparent attempt to prevent the spread\\nof news about the Timisoara protest, the largest demonstration\\nagainst Ceausescu's policies since the Brasov riots.\\n   Romania has little tradition of democratic rule.
