# Homework5: Relevance Assessments, IR Evaluation

Code submitted by : < Rohith Chandra Kandambeth > | < CS6200> | < 002784518 >

## Objective
In this assignment, you will continue the work from previous HW by evaluating your vertical search engine. You will continue to work within the team you formed earlier.
You will be given queries for your topical crawl. Manual relevance assessments have to be collected, using your vertical search engine and a web interface.

You will have to code up the IR evaluation measures, essentially rewriting treceval. It is ok to look at the provided treceval code, but you have to write your own.
